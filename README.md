## Implementation of a sentiment analysis system from Youtube Video comments with traditional Machine Learning algorithms
We have applied different pre-processing steps to prepare the data. Such as tokenization, emoji and punctuation removal, Stemming. We have experimented with different feature combinations like TF-IDF, CountVectorizer, N-gram. We then did the classification with Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine and K-Nearest Neighbour to find out which model has better performance.

We used comments from Jurassic World Dominion - Official Trailer [HD] for creating our dataset for this system.
